## Concept
- Improve the search function based on Youtube, sort the sequence by assigning a score to the video based on its popularity and title
- Range: stratify result by user views (100 million, 10 million, milion and under). Videos with higher views will be presented at the top of the search.
- Search keywords using filters to select videos under 4 minutes
- Theme: Funny Dogs
  > From the results, calculate scores based on the following keywords (the
  > number in the parentheses represents the weighting factors of the word):
  > dog(5), funniest(4), hilarious(4), laugh(4), tease(4), fail(3), husky(3), corgi(3),
  > ultimate(2), compilation(2)
  > Duplicate words in the title of the same video are only counted once, score equals the sum of all weighting factors.
